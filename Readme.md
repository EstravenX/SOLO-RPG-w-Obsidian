The Pencils and Powers game sheets included in the Vault are downloaded from [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/161858/pencils-powers-volume-1). If you enjoy Pencils and Powers, head over to Board Game Geek to support the author.

If you like this demo Vault, please [buy me a Coffee](https://ko-fi/zsolt).

I am looking for contributors. Feel free to open a PR to add additional game sheets, either further PNP sheets fully configured or other Solo-RPG sheets that are publicly available.
